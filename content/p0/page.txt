<p class="about">

This site is a test to see if Buxville could use a web-interactive tutorial
so the newcomers aren't turned away by sign-lag and massive amounts of information.

</p><p class="about">

To entice newcomers to stay and play with the tutorial for a little while, there could be a
"what role suits you best" quiz, which then leads into a multiple choice server rules page.
Whenever a player gets a rule-question wrong, they are told the correct answer, and the webserver
will add another question before they finish.

</p><p class="about">

If this tutorial works out good, whitelist could be instated again with this webserver telling
Buxville.net who passed the tutorial(automated whitelist?).
