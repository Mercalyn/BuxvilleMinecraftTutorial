e.g.:
<div title="hi"></div> will hovertext "hi" on event, use js to change this from the grey and green arrows

add the progress bar at the bottom

heres how AJAX scripts will work:
any green arrow will be able to move pages, scripts to do that in btomain (main directory)
any local page can turn the arrows green/grey at its disposal, using main directory/content/<page number>/<script>
^ so local pages control their interactivity, and when it gives the green light to give the user option to move on, it will change arrow from grey to green.

also: before page is loaded, local script will change any default green arrows to grey.


AJAX -> variable:
$.get( "ajax/test.html", function( data ) {
  $( ".result" ).html( data );
  alert( "Load was performed." );
});
This example fetches the requested HTML snippet and inserts it on the page.
